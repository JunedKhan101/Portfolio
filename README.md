<p>Hi I'm Juned! (pronounced as Ju-ned)</p>
<h3>What drives me?</h3>
<p>
	I am just a super curious individual, driven by a
	thirst for understanding things with a scientific
	mindset.
	<br />I thrive on the thrill of discovery, diving
	headfirst into new subjects and emerging with a
	profound sense of fulfillment.
</p>
<h3>Programming:</h3>
<p>
	I really enjoy learning, and programming has taught
	me that there's no end to it.
</p>
<p>
	I love to build projects, I'm always working on one
	behind the scenes.
	<br />
	I'm currently teaching myself and researching about
	image comparison algorithms to build a project.
